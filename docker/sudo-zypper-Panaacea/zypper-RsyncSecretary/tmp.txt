🧪 rsyncd.conf Example
Ensure you’re using:

log file = /var/log/rsyncd.log
Make sure your host mounts or copies that file into the container.

👣 Steps to Run
# Start everything
docker compose up --build
To simulate logs:

echo "2025/07/22 18:30:00 [12345] connect from 192.0.2.42" >> rsyncd.log
echo "2025/07/22 18:30:01 [12345] sent 2097152 bytes  received 0 bytes  total size 2097152" >> rsyncd.log
Check MongoDB:

docker exec -it rsync-parser mongo
> use aptlantis
> db.rsync_logs.find().pretty()
🔐 Privacy
To go fully anonymous:

Replace IPs with salted hashes or CIDR truncation.

Omit timestamps or reduce precision to hour or day.
